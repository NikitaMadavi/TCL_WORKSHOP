## Overview

Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted scripting language designed to be simple yet powerful. In Tcl, every operation is treated as a commandâ€”including core programming constructs such as variable assignment and procedure definitions.

This repository provides a structured progression from introductory concepts to advanced scripting techniques using Tcl, specifically in the context of digital design and synthesis workflows. The content is derived from a hands-on workshop focused on scripting for synthesis flows using the VSDSYNTH toolbox and tools like Yosys and OpenTimer.

## Workshop Agenda

### **Day 1: Introduction to TCL and VSDSYNTH Toolbox Usage**
- Basic Introduction to Tcl
- Initial Setup and Simple Tasks

### **Day 2: Variable Creation and Processing Constraints from CSV**
- Generate formatted variables and SDC constraints from CSV files
- Read and process design constraints using CSV input

### **Day 3: Processing Clock and Input Constraints**
- Parse and handle clock constraint files
- Implement input timing constraint processing

### **Day 4: Complete Scripting and Yosys Synthesis Introduction**
- Create and execute a full Tcl script for constraint download
- Introduction to Yosys synthesis tool
- Script for hierarchy checks and error handling in Yosys

### **Day 5: Advanced Scripting Techniques and Quality of Results (QoR) Generation**
- Scripting the main synthesis flow and editing output files
- Advanced Tcl procedures (`procs`)
- Clock generation constraint interpretation
- Interpretation of IO delays and transition constraints
- Handling bussed ports and creating configuration files for OpenTimer
- Development of a QoR generation algorithm
